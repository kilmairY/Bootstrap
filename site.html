			<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
			<div class="row" >
				<div class="col" style="background-color:lightblue; text-align:center;"> So whats is HTML? </div>
			</div>
			<p></p>
			<p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series
				of <mark>elements</mark>, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a
				certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing <mark>tags</mark> can make a word or image hyperlink to
				somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For
				example, take the following line of content:
			</p>
			<i>my cat is very grumpy</i>
